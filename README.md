# React + TypeScript + Vite

Hello there!  
This project is to showcase a little fun weather app that I made using the following tech stack:
* Typescript
* React & Redux
* OpenWeatherMap API (REST API using Axios)
* Sass modules for styling (Basically supercharged css)

## Installation

1. To run it, first you will need to contact me (@yuriypyrih@gmail.com)  
and ask for the secret .env file! (Cannot go out there uploading my api keys ðŸ˜‡)


2. Then simply run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
3. You will find more of my thought process in the comments them alongside the code.
